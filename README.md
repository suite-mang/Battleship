# Battleship
Both players add the ships to their fields one by one (no peeking!), and then start shelling each other until one of them succeeds. To make the game fair and prevent the players from peeping at each other's fields, after each move add the message "Press Enter and pass the move to another player", which will clear the screen.

Objectives
To complete this stage and the entire project, add a PvP component to your game. Now the player will see not only the opponent's screen but their own as well. Place the opponent's screen at the top and your field at the bottom.
